	<h1 class="Welc">Welcome To Matthew's Portfolio</h1>
	<h2 class="About">About Me:</h2>
	<p class="ab">So a little about me, I am quite a young adventurous person who loves the outdoors, but very frequently finds himself inside due to my love of computers and technology in general.
		I am an avid gamer who loves puzzle games and adventure games in perticular but my real passion is tinkering with tech but also coding in general.
		I really just love messing around with technology whether it be coding related or hardware related, I love to see what it does when you change something, see the cause and effect in action, see what makes it tick.
		I am also a lover of films and series but in perticular the cinematography behind it. How the lighting is set up, How a certain shot is set up in a perticular way to show something about the character, I really appreciate the directers.
		Furthermore, I have a craving to know more I feel like knowledge is never ending and you can always know more about a topic you enjoy. I feel you should know that I created this website entirely by scratch, no AI, no webite creater, just a lot of googling and know how.
		<br><br>Now for some of the less heavy hitting things:<br><br>My favourite colour is <span style="color: red; -webkit-text-stroke: 2px #000000; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Red</span><br>I own two cats, called melody and mittensüêà
